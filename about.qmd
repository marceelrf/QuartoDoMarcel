Hello, my name is Marcel Ferreira (or Marshall) and I am a Data Scientist and Researcher in Biomaterials and Bioinformatics applied in 3D Bioprinting. Currently my research is focused on bone tissue.

Welcome to my blog where I will provide professional content about R, machine learning, biomaterials and bioinformatics, among others, and also personal content about the glorious SÃ£o Paulo Futebol Clube.

This blog is my first adventure using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)!

You can find me on the social networks below (***Important***: My twitter is for mostly personal content, please don't take me seriously!).
