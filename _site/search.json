But many users start without taking the time to assimilate the different types of objects, which leads to mistakes that could simply be avoided. This in turn can lead to frustration, which is the gateway to the dark side of the force.\nvia GIPHY\nWhen I started analyzing data with R I was on a very tight deadline and had to skip these steps, and I made a lot of mistakes. Really, a lot!\nSo in this post I will talk about the basic object types, or classes, in R. Basic but effective. I hope it helps you."

    "text": "Atomic data\nThese are the basic data classes in R. More complex objects will always be built using them. There are 6 classes in R: logical, integer, real, complex, string (or character) and raw. logical are values like TRUE or FALSE (Known as Booleans). integer, real and complex are numeric types. character are values like words, in other languages this type of values are call as strings. And about raw I must be honest with you. I have never used it!\n\n#logical\nTRUE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n#integer\n1L\n\n[1] 1\n\n#real\n1.2\n\n[1] 1.2\n\n#complex\ncomplex(real = 1,imaginary = 2)\n\n[1] 1+2i\n\n#character\n\"String\"\n\n[1] \"String\"\n\n\nYou may have notice that there is special ways to create these objects. We use \"\" to define a character. We add L to the end of a number to make it explicit that it is an integer. We need the complex() function to create a complex number. And logicals are defined by the uppercase words TRUE and FALSE, and their respective initials, T and F."

    "section": "Vectors",
    "text": "Vectors\nVectors are one-dimensional objects composed of a set of elements, where the order does not necessarily have a meaning, serving only to locate the element in the vector. The functions c() is used to create vector in R.\n\nv1 <- c(1,3,5)\nv1\n\n[1] 1 3 5\n\nv2 <- c(\"ball\",\"house\")\nv2\n\n[1] \"ball\"  \"house\"\n\nv3 <- c(T,T,F)\nv3\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThe operator [] can be used to extract the element of certain position in a vector. For example, let’s extract the second element of the vectors v1, v2 and v3.\n\nv1[2]\n\n[1] 3\n\nv2[2]\n\n[1] \"house\"\n\nv3[2]\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nPay attention when use this operator to not try access an non existing position in a vector. such as trying to access the fourth element in a vector (v1) with only three elements. This will result in a NA value, which is represent the missing values in R, which are a very important topic that I will cover in the future. Stay tuned!\n\nv1[4]\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThere are other ways to create vectors in R considering their classes that I will dedicate a separate post for this.\nIn R different classes cannot coexist in the same vector (we will see what a vector is later, for now just trust me) and there is coercion when we put them together. Coercion occurs in the following order:\ncharacter > complex > real > integer > logical\nThis means, if you put a character and a numeric together in a vector, R will coerce the numeric to become a character. If you put a logical in the same vector as a numeric it will be turned into a numeric. The functions class() and typeof() can be used to check the class and type, respectively, of R objects.\n\n#class and typeof usage\nclass(\"ball\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ntypeof(1L)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\nclass(1.2)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n#coercion\nobj1 <-c(\"ball\",1)\nclass(obj1)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ntypeof(obj1)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nobj2 <-c(TRUE,1)\nclass(obj2)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\ntypeof(obj2)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nThis behavior is the source of major errors and it is always necessary to check that your objects are of the desired class. After all, it is impossible to perform mathematical operations with character in R, for example.\nHowever, the coercion behavior can be used to our advantage in the case of the trick of using logicals and numeric together. Like in the case where we want to know how many numbers in an vector are greater than a certain value. By using the > (greater than) operator we perform a logical test that returns TRUE/FALSE values. The sum() function, on the other hand, adds up all the elements of a vector and if it receives a logical vector it will transform TRUE into 1 and FALSE into 0.\n\n#a numeric vector\nv1 <- c(1,2,3,2,4,5,8,2,1)\n\n\n#logical test\nv1 > 3\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n#use sum to get how many numbers are grater than 3\nsum(v1 > 3)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThe post is getting long, so that’s it for now! In the next one we will talk about objects with larger dimensions like matrix and data.frame.\nI’m waiting for you!"

But, as you can imagine, it’s not always possible to represent our data using one-dimensional object. When talking about two-dimensional objects tables are something extremely common in our daily lives. R has two types of objects for representing tables (2D objects): matrix and data.frames, very similar objects, but with one very important difference: matrix only accept ONE atomic class, while data.frames accept ONE per column."

Thinking about data analysis, in a data frame each column is a variable and each row is an observation.\nWe build data.frames with the function data.frame\n\ndf1 <- data.frame(var1 = c(1,2,3,4),\n                  var2 = c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"),\n                  var3 = c(T,T,T,F))\ndf1\n\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a  TRUE\n2    2    b  TRUE\n3    3    c  TRUE\n4    4    d FALSE\n\n\nExtracting vectors\n\ndf1$var1\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\ndf1$var2\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\"\n\ndf1$var3\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nAs for matrix, we can use squartebrackets to extract elements (although I recommend extracting using the $ operator first).\n\n#Using squarebrackets\ndf1[2,2]\n\n[1] \"b\"\n\n#Using the $\ndf1$var2[2]\n\n[1] \"b\"\n\n\nThe names of columns (or variable) can be used in the squarebracket to extract the column.\n\ndf1[,\"var1\"]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nFor matrix and for data.frames we can find the sizes of the dimensions with the functions nrow(), ncol(), and dim(), which return the number of rows, columns, and both, respectively.\n\n#number of rows\nnrow(df1)\n\n[1] 4\n\n#number of columns\nncol(df1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n#length of dimensions\ndim(df1)\n\n[1] 4 3\n\n\nSo far, so good.

    "text": "Lists\nLists are objects similar to vectors, but each element can be a different object. That is, a list can contain a vector in one element, a matrix or data.frame in another, and even a list in a given element. That’s right, lists within lists.\n\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\n\nThe function list() is used to create a list in R:\n\nv1 <- c(1,3,5,7)\nv2 <- c(\"a\",\"b\")\ndf1 <- data.frame(var1 = c(1,2,3,4),\n                  var2 = c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"),\n                  var3 = c(T,T,T,F))\n\nl1 <- list(v1,v2,df1)\nl1\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1 3 5 7\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n[[3]]\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a  TRUE\n2    2    b  TRUE\n3    3    c  TRUE\n4    4    d FALSE\n\n\nWe can see that the output of a list contains differences from the others that we have seen. Each element number on a list is printed by R with double square brackets. Then R will print the elements as we have seen for each class.\nThis is something important to note when talking about how we extract elements from lists. If we use the single bracket operator the output will be a list, but only containing the element of that index.\n\n#Single square bracket\nl1[2]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n#Double square bracket\nl1[[2]]\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n\nWe can use the class() function to check the output classes.\n\n#Single square bracket\nclass(l1[2])\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n#Double square bracket\nclass(l1[[2]])\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nWhen working with lists we can access elements internal to a given list element. To do this we use a double square bracket followed by a single square bracket. Example, let’s extract the third element contained in the first element of the list l1.\n\n# The third element in the first list element\nl1[[1]][3]\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe third element of l1 is a data.frame, we can extract its columns or rows in a similar way.\n\n#The first column of the data.frame in the third list element\nl1[[3]][,1]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n#The rows number 2 and 3 in the data.frame in the third list element\nl1[[3]][2:3,]\n\n  var1 var2 var3\n2    2    b TRUE\n3    3    c TRUE\n\n\nJust as we can name columns and rows in data.frames/matrix, we can name each element in a list. This is done using the names() function.\n\n#unamed list\nnames(l1)\n\nNULL\n\nnames(l1) <- c(\"element1\",\"element2\",\"element3\")\n\n#named list\nnames(l1)\n\n[1] \"element1\" \"element2\" \"element3\"\n\n\nAnd, as you may be wondering, we can use these names to extract elements from the list by passing them in the single or double square bracket operators.\n\nl1\n\n$element1\n[1] 1 3 5 7\n\n$element2\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n$element3\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a  TRUE\n2    2    b  TRUE\n3    3    c  TRUE\n4    4    d FALSE\n\n#Single square bracket\nl1[c(\"element1\",\"element3\")]\n\n$element1\n[1] 1 3 5 7\n\n$element3\n  var1 var2  var3\n1    1    a  TRUE\n2    2    b  TRUE\n3    3    c  TRUE\n4    4    d FALSE\n\n#Double square bracket\nl1[[\"element1\"]]\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7"
