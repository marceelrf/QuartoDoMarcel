I am very happy because when I started using R to analyze my FTIR (infrared spectroscopy) data I could not apply tidyverse functions to my pipelines. It took me months of wracking my brains to find a model to leverage the existing packages and connect them to the tidyverse.\nYou can check the github repository.\nEnjoy!"
